+Gluon 2018.2.4
+==============
+
+End of life
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+This will be the final release of the v2018.2.x series. Updating to the v2019.1.x release series is the recommended course of action, which should be fairly easy.
+
+Bugfixes
+~~~~~~~~
+
+* Fixes device alias for Ubiquiti UniFi AC LR. (`#1834 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1834>`_)
+  Autoupdates on this model were impossible before, since we were missing the proper device alias.
+
+* Add correct ath10k firmware package for OCEDO Koala. (`#1838 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/1838>`_)
+
+* Fixes various batman-adv bugs with backports from 2019.4 and 2019.5 by updating the openwrt-routing packages feed
+
+Other changes
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+* Linux kernel has been updated to either
+  
+  - 4.9.207 (ar71xx, brcm2708, mpc85xx) or
+  - 4.14.160 (ipq40xx, ipq806x, mvebu, ramips, sunxi, x86).
+
+Known issues
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are
+  unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)
+
+  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.
+
+* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is
+  disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)
+
+  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected
+  (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).
+
+* Inconsistent respondd API
+  (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)
+
+  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API
+  will still be supported for a while.
+
+* Frequent reboots due to out-of-memory or high load due to memory pressure on
+  weak hardware especially in larger meshes
+  (`#1243 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1243>`_)
+
+  Optimizations in Gluon 2018.1 have significantly improved memory usage.
+  There are still known bugs leading to unreasonably high load that we hope to
+  solve in future releases.
